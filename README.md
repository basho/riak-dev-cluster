Riak Dev Cluster for OS X
=========================

*NOTE: This project currently installs Riak 2.1.3*

Easily run a 5-node [Riak](http://www.basho.com/riak) cluster on OS X.

This repository uses the pre-packaged binaries for OS X to embed the
Erlang runtime. This eliminates the need to build Riak from source and
install Erlang. For convenience, the binaries can be found in the Basho
[Downloads](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/downloads/).

By default, the rake task installs 5 nodes of Riak running on a local
machine in a fashion similar to the `devrel` build target. In essence,
it creates five full Riak stacks (including Erlang virtual machines) to
run on one server to simulate a cluster. This is useful in a development
environment, but running Riak on a single server for benchmarking or
production use is counterproductive. This is discussed in greater detail
in a blog post entitled [*Riak Development Anti-Patterns*](http://basho.com/riak-development-anti-patterns/)

## Important Considerations
* The names of the nodes are riak[1-5]@127.0.0.1
* The HTTP port of riak1 is 11098: <http://127.0.0.1:11098>
* Ports on other nodes are 12098, 13098, 14098 & 15098.
* Protobuf port of riak1 is 11087.
* Handoff port of riak1 is 11099.
* https port is off, or same as http port.
* Riak Control (Admin UI) is available [here](http://127.0.0.1:11098/admin)
* All nodes use the [LevelDB storage backend](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/leveldb/)
* [Riak Search](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/search/) is disabled 
* The `/etc/riak.conf` in each node's directory enumerates all other
  ports and settings

## Getting started

1) Ensure that Open File Limits are set per most recent documentation
recommendations. recommendations. This step, which is manual, is
important to ensure that Riak behaves properly. [Open File Limits](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/tuning/open-files-limit/#Mac-OS-X)

2) Clone the repository and navigate to the folder:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/basho/riak-dev-cluster.git
$ cd riak-dev-cluster
```

3) There is a `bootstrap` command available that downloads the
pre-packaged OS X binary, installs, starts, and joins the Riak cluster
in one go:

```
rake bootstrap
```

4) Verify that all nodes have started, and joined the cluster:

````
rake member_status
````

5) Riak is up and running! You can [Test the Cluster](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/quickstart/#Test-the-Cluster)
or progress directly to [A Taste of Riak](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/taste-of-riak/)

## Control commands

This project includes multiple rake tasks that make interacting with
your Riak cluster nearly as simple as operating a cluster in production.
Several of the common tasks are enumerated in greater detail below.

```
rake start
```

Start all nodes in the cluster using the Riak command line option [start](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/tools/riak/#start):
`./riak[1-5]/bin/riak start`. 

```
rake stop
```

Stop all nodes in the cluster using the Riak command line option [stop](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/tools/riak/#stop):
`./riak[1-5]/bin/riak stop`. 

```
rake clear
```

Clear all data by first completing the `rake stop` task and then
deleting directories (via rm -rf).

```
rake restart
```

Restart all nodes in the cluster without clearing all data by running
the `rake stop` task followed by the `rake start` task.

```
rake join
```

Join all nodes as a cluster using the Riak command line option
[join](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/tools/riak-admin/#join)
with the force option. If the cluster is stopped or restarted, this
command only needs issued once. If the cluster is cleared, it must be
reissued:  `./riak[2-5]/bin/riak-admin join -f riak1@127.0.0.1`. 

## Riak Data Types

There are a few `rake` commands that will set up your cluster to use
[Riak Data Types](http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/dev/using/data-types/). You can
create a [bucket type](http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.2/dev/advanced/bucket-types/) for
using [Riak counters](http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.2/dev/using/data-types/#Counters)
called `counters`:

```
rake counter_bucket
```

You can do the same for sets:

```
rake set_bucket
```

And for maps:

```
rake map_bucket
```

## Other commands

See all available commands by running `rake -T` or just `rake` by itself.

### Note

Depending on your Erlang cookie, you may have to use the commands with `sudo`.
